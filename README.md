# R Project: Predictive Modelling to determine success of ICO campaigns

## Background to problem statement:
Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is like an IPO (Initial Public Offering). It is a way for a venture to raise money from public. But there are important differences. In an IPO, an investor gets shares of the company in return whereas in an ICO, an investor gets tokens/coins in return which are based on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). The most popular technology in DLT is blockchain technology. In ICO, the tokens issued have no real world value. They can only be used in the ecosystem of venturesâ€™ itself which they are building.
The majority of ICO campaign follow an 'all-or-nothing' approach in which the fundraising team or company sets a fundraising goal (such as $2 million in 60 days). If they raise sufficient funds to achieve their objective, the ICO will be deemed a success. Otherwise, their fundraising efforts will be fruitless, and they will receive nothing.

## Aim of the project:
The aim of project is to build a machine learning model which would predict whether a team/company will reach its fundraising goal successfully through the ICO.

## Key tasks performed:
1. Data exploration
2. Data preprocessing (handling missing values, incorrect values, outliers)
3. Processing data to suite specific requirement of algorithm (one hot encoding for SVM and ANN model)
4. Running different models (Decision Tree, Adaboost, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine,  Artificial Neural Network)
5. Evaluating and selecting the best model

## Use Case of the project:
The model can be used by investors, founders and regulators. Founders can use the model to foresee success of their ICO campaign based on features which are used in the model. It can signal them to take corrective action if required in their product strategy. Investors can use the model to get an indication about which ICO campaigns are strong and should be selected for making investment. Regulators can use the model to supplement their understanding of the ICO sector. Using this model, they can predict which ICO campaigns would be successful then they can review this after 6 months or 1 year to see what happened to those ventures and develop an understanding about sector and assess the need to bring fresh statutory requirements.
